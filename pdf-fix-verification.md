## Troubleshooting

If issues persist after applying the fixes, check the following:

4. Try a different browser to isolate browser-specific issues
5. Open the diagnostic.html file to get detailed information about your environment

## Technical Notes

The fixes address the following issues:

1. **Worker Initialization**: Changed the worker creation to use a classic (non-module) worker
2. **importScripts Support**: Ensured worker can use importScripts to load PDF.js and PDF-lib
3. **Array Handling**: Fixed improper array checking in PDFPreview component
4. **Error Handling**: Improved error handling throughout all PDF components
